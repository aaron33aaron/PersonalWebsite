                  <p> I am a 21 year old Computer Programming student from Pickering, Ontario, Canada. My interests include full-stack development, meeting new people
                    and making connections, travelling and exploring new and emerging technologies.
                  </p>

                  <p> Database Design, Web Development, Web Applications, Mobile Development, Software Development Life Cycle, Mainframe Development, Android Development, IT in Business and Game Development.</p>
                  <p>Tools, Languages and Technologies:</p>

                  <h3>Education</h3>
                  <p>I started my studies at Frenchman's Bay public school
                    where I completed my studies in English and French which has granted me the benefit of being bilingual. I then
                    attended Dunbarton Highschool where I explored my interests and developed a passion for the power that technology
                    holds and the benefits it could bring to people across the world. This lead me to enrolling in Game Development and 
                    Entrepernership at Ontario Tech University where I furthered my soft and hard skills, eventually switching over to the
                    Durham College Computer Programming and Analysis program where I have made great connections in several industries and furthered my skills 
                    such as database development, front-end development, back-end development and working with clients to reach their vision
                    for their products. I have completed the University of Helsinki's Element's of AI course which has furthered my knowledge and skills
                    when working with machine learning, neural networks, the philosophy of artificial intelligence, and using artificial intelligence to solve problems.
                    I have also completed the ConsenSys Academy Blockchain Foundations and Use Cases course which has expanded my knowledge on the fundamentals of how 
                    blockchains work, their uses and how and when they should be implemented.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <h3>My Next Steps </h3>
                  <p> After finishing my last year of college I plan on continuing my education in blockchain core development and front end development
                    as I am striving to pursue a career in blockchain development to further build upon the ecosystems that currently exists while providing new revolutionary
                  solutions to issues currently faced within the industry. My main area of focus will be smart contract development to build decentralized applications that any regular
                user can interface with through the internet to give more people access to decentralized applications and the potential they hold.</p>
